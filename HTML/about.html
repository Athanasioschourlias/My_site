                        <p>This is a language we leared,the basics, at our first year in college, wich i thought was really cool to know once this is a language you
                            need to know if you want to write a program or drivers with maximum efficiency. Because of that i’m still reading about C and
                            learnig new things, and in the way as i was geting involved with the game development i "extended" my C knowledge with C# which i like a lot

                            but it’s a cool language to know and with many uses in the modern world.

                        <p>Javascript was a language i was kind of forced to learn in order to complete some of my projects including this one, but in the way 
                            i descovered what this language is capable of.I now look forword to learn more about javascript and expand my knowledge by learning
                            nodejs too and do some cool stuf with this web page.

                            Java is the first language i started messing around with.Also "Head first java"(a programming book for learning java) was my first
                            programming book i ever purchased.The reason behind my motivation and excitement was a game known to every one by this time "minecraft",
                            my plan was to learn enough so i can make a simple clone of minecraft for starters and evolve from there, of course i dind't made 
                            a clone of minecraft because i found out what a fullstack developer is, and at the time i wasn't one, so i kept reading the book
                            and make simple and some more complex algorithms.To this day i haven't use java to any of my projects but i plan to read that book one more time.

                        For the time being my work consists mainly from  mini projects I came up with. Those projects arise either from things that I found non 
                        practical in my everyday life so I decided to try and fix them with the help of software engineering, 
                        or they are just random ideas that popped in my mind while driving or taking a bath (the bath is more inspiring 
                        than driving I have to say!). Among the last ones, you may find some very interesting group projects, coming 
                        either from the University or from private groups. Hopefully, a brighter future awaits with me being involved 
                        in interesting collaborations in bigger projects. <a href="./projects.html">You can read more here.</a>

                        My full name, as you may have already guessed, is Athanasios Chourlias and I’m currently studying Computer Science, 
                        at <a href="https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/" target="_blank">Harokopeio University of Athens</a>. That makes me feel lucky,
                         as not as many people as you might think are able to study and work with what they are passionate about. 
                         You ask where that passion comes from? Well, I was always a curious person, and one thing that caught my 
                         attention the most, was electronic devices, especially electronic computers and what goes on “behind the scenes”
                          or for lack of a better word “behind the screen”.  That curiosity ended up with me reading and learning every day 
                          more and more about programming and software development. That was when I got my first Arduino and started 
                          experimenting with it. At the time, little I knew that I was actually doing was learning my first “programming” 
                          language. All these little projects brought me joy and made me feel like I do something meaningful, so I kept 
                          experimenting, failing hard, learning and trying again and again. As the years went by, I kept learning new stuff, 
                          such as the different fields in Computers Science and the different types of software development, and I kept on 
                          seeking more information for the ones I found the most interesting. Now, after all these years, and all the
                          experience I gained, through research and mini experiments, I believe I have a clearer view of what “path”
                          I want to follow. That is to get to know more about A.I research and development and create algorithms.
