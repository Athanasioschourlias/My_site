                  <p class="card-text">
                    That is one of my favorite interviews I have ever attended, since the interviewer is my favorite pressman, 
                    but that is not all of it. This interview took almost an hour to complete, maybe it sounds short but it was 
                    too long for an interview of 15 questions that required small and simple answers. It ended up like that because
                     all the four drivers in that room were joking around (thankfully, it was the end of the day).

                  <p class="card-text">
                    One of the most special races I have had was the one when my hometown truck managed to “convince” the 
                    federation(OMAE) to organize a race there, after almost 6 racing seasons. However, I didn’t know
                     whether I could make it to the race, and for that reason, my team could not prepare either. 
                     Thankfully, the very last moment I sent a message to my team that I will be able to attend the 
                     race so my favorite mechanic came to meet me. We did our best, had a ton of fun and in the process 
                     we won the race. In the end of the day I enjoyed it, I’m not quite sure about my team and the stand 
                     I made them pull.Thank you Prtmotosport.<a href="https://www.prt.gr/">Thank you Prtmotosport</a>.<small>(This article does not have translation)</small>
