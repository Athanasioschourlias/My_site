                    <p>This is a language we leared,the basics, at our first year in college, wich i thought was really cool to know once this is a language you
                        need to know if you want to write a program or drivers with maximum efficiency. Because of that i’m still reading about C and
                        learnig new things, and in the way as i was geting involved with the game development i "extended" my C knowledge with C# which i like a lot

                    <p>Javascript was a language i was kind of forced to learn in order to complete some of my projects including this one, but in the way 
                        i descovered what this language is capable of.I now look forword to learn more about javascript and expand my knowledge by learning
                        nodejs too.

                    <p>java was the first language i learned in my carrer.why?I was inspired by minecraft and i had as my goal to learn java in order to make a 
                        clone of minecraft and have my features in that game.I also leared java because i always wanted to become a game developer, 
                        so knowing that java is the language most games are written on,with other languages too,made me to want to master that programming
