                <p>This is a language we leared,the basics, at our first year in college, wich i thought was really cool to know once this is a language you
                    need to know if you want to write a program or drivers with maximum efficiency. Because of that i’m still reading about C and
                    learnig new things, and in the way as i was geting involved with the game development i "extended" my C knowledge with C# which i like a lot

                <p>This is a language i started learing the last few months because in it’s most part is an easy one and i would really like to get involved with
                    data sience in the future.
